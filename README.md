# Flask FoodTrackerApp
This is a simple Food Tracker Flask app.
In this project I practised in writing raw SQL queries as well as got familiar with Flask framework.
Using this application, you can keep track of the amount of calories you absorbed throughout a particular day.
You can add a new date in order to add consumed products for that date.
You can add the amount of fats, carbohydrates, protein and the name of product you consumed.
You can see the total amount of calories you consumed for the particular day on the main page , also you can go and look at the details of the consumed items.
